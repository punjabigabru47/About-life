    <h2>My name is John and living simple life saved my life</h2>
    <p><strong>I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things which i thought i loved
    but the truth was i coudn't even appriciate any of it, because there was too much.</p>
    <p>Things were horrible, job i hated and house i didnt want to live in and i coudnt hold
      the relationship.</p>

      <h3>>How i turned things around</h3>
      <p><strong>I was on the verge of the breakdown when i got rid of everything</strong>.
      I litterly put 90% of my possessions in garbage and sold my place and moved into a smaller
      appartment, and i quit my job</p>
      <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in bad place. I didn't know what
        to do, and eventually in worked.
      </p>

      <h3>>Now i live the simple life</h3>
      <p>Now that im living simple life, things are much better now. i'm less stressed, enjoy my
        life and work more and i have more free time to enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>With how much it turned my life around,<strong> I felt like i had no choice but start 
        to sharring how i did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living simple life 
        as well, which is why i started this site.</p>
